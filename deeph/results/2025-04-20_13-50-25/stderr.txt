/home2/yashas.b/miniconda3/envs/dft/lib/python3.9/site-packages/deeph/model.py:681: UserWarning: The use of `x.T` on tensors of dimension other than 2 to reverse their shape is deprecated and it will throw an error in a future release. Consider `x.mT` to transpose batches of matrices or `x.permute(*torch.arange(x.ndim - 1, -1, -1))` to reverse the dimensions of a tensor. (Triggered internally at /pytorch/aten/src/ATen/native/TensorShape.cpp:3725.)

/home2/yashas.b/miniconda3/envs/dft/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch/package/package_exporter.py:921: UserWarning: TypedStorage is deprecated. It will be removed in the future and UntypedStorage will be the only storage class. This should only matter to you if you are using storages directly.  To access UntypedStorage directly, use tensor.untyped_storage() instead of tensor.storage()
